I am following this tutorial https://tensorflow-object-detection-api-tutorial.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html
python 3.11.9 
install visual studio code and microsoft c++ build tools 2022 and then add desktop development c++ while installing then add edit system variable 
pip install tensorflow 2.15.0 								
pip install protobuf 3.20.3								
download zip folder of 3.20.3 windows version from github release 								
add  protoc.exe or application from the bin folder after unziping the folder then add the exe file into the scripts of virtual environment 								
From within TensorFlow/models/research/
protoc object_detection/protos/*.proto --python_out=.
pip install cython
pip install git+https://github.com/philferriere/cocoapi.git#subdirectory=PythonAPI"						[donot skip the cocoapi ]		
after that 	pip uninstall Cython -y							
# From within TensorFlow/models/research/
cp object_detection/packages/tf2/setup.py .
python -m pip install .
				
that will uninstall tensorflow 2.15.0 so install this  tensorflow 2.15.0  version again 								
"then run the test.py file which will again give error like    from tensorflow.python.keras.layers.preprocessing import image_preprocessing as image_ops
ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'tensorflow.python.keras.layers.preprocessing'"								
can solve this error by doing this 		"Go to this file ""....conda\virtualenvs\tfCV\Lib\site-packages\official\vision\image_classification\augment.py"" on your device and change line 31 to this:
from tensorflow.keras.preprocessing import image as image_ops"						
source : https://github.com/tensorflow/models/issues/10505								
then run the test python file
